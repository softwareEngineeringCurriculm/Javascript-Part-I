# [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com): JavaScript Part I: Foundations of Programming - Workshop

## Overview

#### Scheduled Length: 1.5 Hours

Hey there! Ready to get your hands dirty with some code? This is the practice exercise repository for Hack Reactor's JavaScript Part I workshop. JavaScript Part I is the first lesson in our free, seven-part Introductory JavaScript Series. We're excited to have you.

In order to complete these exercises, open [repl.it](https://repl.it/), choose JavaScript, and then write your code in the left-hand panel. You can run your code using the "Run" button.

**EXPECTATION:** You will be expected to fully engage during lecture periods. Accordingly, please wait until the designated times during this live workshop to explore the exercises. You will be given 10-15 minutes per section, so please pace yourself accordingly.

**NEED HELP?** Practice developing your autonomy as a programmer. Use [Google Search](https://www.google.com) or [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com), peruse documentation at [mdn.io](https://www.mdn.io), or talk to your friendly neighbor. If you're utterly stuck, flag down your instructor for guidance.

**_DISCLAIMER:_** _Completion of this workshop is no guarantee of admission into the Hack Reactor immersive program, nor does it have any influence in the admissions process._

## Exercises

Each lecture in this workshop will be followed by a set of self-guided practice exercises. The exercises are divided by section and are housed in their respective folders within this Github repository.

Each section of practice exercises has a `Basic Requirements` portion. Some sections may also contain additional sections for advanced practice. During the live workshop, you are only expected to complete the `Basic Requirements` sections and may complete the remainder as homework.

## Thinking about JavaScript

##### Reasoning Methods

As you embark on your learning journey, a sound method for thinking about JavaScript will be to consider each line of code as a discrete instruction being provided to your computer.

- What is each line of code intended to do individually?
- How about when combined together?

It will be beneficial for your growth as a sophisticated programmer to think deeply about the intentions of your code so you can predict and understand the behavior your program produces.

- _What_ is the expected output of the code?
- _Why_ will the code produce the output that I expect?

Thinking about each line of code can take many shapes:
- How is this line of code structured and why?
- What syntax rules is this line of code following? Not following?
- Where is this line of code located contextually within the program?
- What references is this line of code making to other parts of the program? Are such references sound?

##### Vocabulary Development

Developing your vocabulary as a programmer is as important as learning to write code. To accelerate your conversational capabilities, we recommend partnering with a neighbor to discuss your code at every opportunity. The more opportunities you have to explain yourself, the better. Don't worry – with time, the ambiguity with which you presently speak about code will  transform into eloquent prose.
